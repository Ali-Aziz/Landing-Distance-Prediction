# Landing-Distance-Prediction

Title: Modeling the Landing Distance using Linear Regression

Background: Flight landing

Motivation: To reduce the risk of landing overrun

Goal: To study what factors and how they would impact the landing distance of a commercial flight

Data: Landing data (landing distance and other parameters) from 950 commercial flights (not real data set but simulated from statistical models). See two Excel files ‘FAA-1.xls’ (800 flights) and ‘FAA-2.xls’ (150 flights).

Files: Flight_landing_distance_prediction.R contains the code and Report.pdf describes the whole analysis step by step.
